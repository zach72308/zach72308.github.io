            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIrEgmzaegg" target="_blank">Jacob</a> is a <em>Cobalt Blue</em> morph of the <em>Cherax Destructor</em> species of crayfish, which originates from Australia and is one of the largest crayfish species. This species can live for anything between 3 and 8 years old, potentially reachin a foot in length.<br>
            <br>
            Jacob is currently larger than my and and is of unknown age. Jacob's diet consists mostly of steak and premade shrimp food pellets.
            Jacob takes about 25% of my sanity as he plays dead(very convincingly) and will hide the food he gets, letting it rot.

                This unnamed crayfish is of unknown species, origin, and age. It has a similar diet to Jacob, but in smaller portions.<br>
                It takes less than 5% of my sanity to take care of this crayfish - it would be zero, but it can be hard to get it to eat sometimes.

                    These are a variety of neocaridina morphs(color/patterns) that are also differeent generations/ages - some are children of others. They are very easy to care for, needing sparse maintenance for their filter and tank walls(algae control).<br>
                    They are very simple pets that take none of my sanity to handle.

                Terrestrial hermit crabs are social animals that need at least on cohabitant of the same species. They are scavenging prey animals that need deep substrate to burrow in and plenty of food thats rich in protein and calcium to thrive.
                These crabs switch shells every so often to allow themselves a cofortable place to grow in, and will go into their burrows for long periods of time to molt(similar to shedding skin).
                <br>Hermit Crabs are relativly low maintenance and can be very friendly to their humans, and they take none of my sanity to take care of.

                This is my black cat Poseidon. She is <strong>VERY</strong> food motivated and will put her claws into your back if you don't share food(sharing is caring). She is also very cuddly and will demand pets or cuddles by patting you gently on the arm twice. Her favorite foods include hard-boiled egg yolk, bell pepper stems, mellon rinds, and whole wheat bread heels. She is exceptionally quiet, only making sounds when scared, angry, uncomfortable, or looking for people.
                She takes 15% of y sanity to take care of, because she is pick, very messy, occasionally skittish, and mean.

                This is my other cat, Athena. She is <strong><em>VERY</em></strong> talkative. She will scream at you for attention and then headbut everything near you until she gets the attention she deserves. She will beg for your food, then refuse it - unless it is tuna. If you pet her, your hand will be covered with fur equivalent to the volume of a mouse. Despite alomst constantly begging for pets, she will attempt to bite your hand off if your hand is a milimeter off of where she wants it - <span id="warning"><strong>BE CAREFUL, FOR THE TUMMY IS A TRAP, IF TOUCHED WHEN EXPOSED, SHE SHALL TRANSFORM INTO A BEAR TRAP AND REMOVE THE OFFENDING HAND.</strong></span>

                They take like 1% of my sanity to take care of. All I need to do is lock them up at night to keep them safe and refil their water dishes.
